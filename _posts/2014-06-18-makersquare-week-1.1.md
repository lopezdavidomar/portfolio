Today we did a large amount of setup through the command line (yikes!) and learned about the fascinating world of git. 

<b>Git:</b><br>
is a distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.<br>
<em><b>Wikipedia (2014). Git (software) Retrieved from </b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>

Like stated above git is a version contrtol system not to be confused with <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">github.com</a> (where git files are stored). It allows multiple individuals to work on software/sites without stepping on each others toes. Pretty cool, huh?

We picked up a few key commands to keep our work saved and up to date on github. I will have to play around with this to get a good grasp on its functionality.
